The Distributed Permutation Flow Shop Scheduling Problem with Worker Flexibility is a new form of the Distributed Flow Shop that is being studied in this study for the first time (DPFSPw). The DPFSPw is a sort of distributed production system in which the production tasks are initially spread among various factories, followed by the execution of the workers' and machines' jobs in turn. In terms of the availability of employees on machines, the optimization criterion is the minimization of the maximum completion time or makespan among the factories. We provide a helpful heuristic to deal with the DPFSPw, which was inspired by the strong performances of certain heuristics in the literature.
